# 👋 Hey, I’m Max  

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m **Max**, a curious explorer with a big passion for **Cybersecurity**. Right now, I’m studying **Computer Science** and **Business**, because I believe the best solutions live at the intersection of tech and people.  

I feel that teaching people about how to use systems securely will benefit anyone and future generations, but how did I start loving cybersecurity and the technological world?

**Primary School**

I loved learning about all the machines built with code, and learned how to use *Scratch*, a block-based coding platform that sparked the fire now we had to ignite it further!
