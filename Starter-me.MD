# 🔐 Cybersecurity Awareness & Best Practices

Maintaining strong cybersecurity is essential for every developer, whether working on personal projects or contributing to open-source communities. This repository serves as a resource hub for understanding and applying security principles in software development.

## 📌 Why Cybersecurity Matters
- **Protects sensitive data**: Prevents unauthorized access to personal, financial, or organizational information.
- **Ensures code integrity**: Guards against malicious injections, tampering, or supply-chain attacks.
- **Builds trust**: Secure projects attract collaborators, users, and employers.
- **Compliance**: Many industries require adherence to strict security standards (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001).

## 🛡️ Core Security Practices
- **[Strong authentication](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Strong%20authentication)**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and avoid password reuse.
- **[Secure coding](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Secure%20coding)**: Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and follow OWASP guidelines.
- **[Regular updates](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Regular%20updates)**: Patch dependencies and frameworks to close vulnerabilities.
- **[Encryption](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Encryption)**: Protect data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
- **[Access control](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Access%20control)**: Apply the principle of least privilege to users and services.
- **[Monitoring & logging](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Monitoring%20%26%20logging)**: Detect anomalies early with proper logging and alert systems.
